          <p>A year ago, a meteorite fell in your town. It landed in your friend Nahum Gardner’s backyard,
             and it was the strangest thing you’d ever seen. The color was indescribable,
             truly not something of this earth. It seemed to sublimate into thin air,
             growing smaller and smaller with every passing day, until it finally vanished entirely.
             However, the strangest thing of all was the events that began to take place at the Gardners’
             some time afterwards.</p>

        <div id="second">
          <p>All the plants around their house began to turn the same color
            as the meteorite had been. When the harvest came, all the fruit was bitter and rotten.
            Some kind of sickness, Nahum said. It got the livestock too; one morning,
            Nahum went to milk the cows, and found that their bodies were going grey and shriveled.
            Parts of them were disintegrating, and other parts simply fell off of the bodies while
            they were still alive. The same was true of the hogs, and the chickens.
            Even the water from their well seemed off. You tasted it when you were visiting once,
            and it was salty, almost fetid. You told Nahum to dig another well, somewhere different,
            but he didn’t listen. </p>

          <div id="third">
            <p>...And then strange things started happening to the people.</p>
            </div>

            <div id="fourth">
              <p> In the spring, Nahum’s wife Abby started going mad.
                Screaming about things that nobody else could see. Clawing at the air.
                It was making the kids hysterical, so he had to "lock her up," he said.</p>
                </div>

                <div id="fifth">
                  <p>That was the last you heard from him. The Gardners were a family of five,
                    but no one’s seen any of them for weeks now. Nobody else wants to go near the farm,
                    so you’ve taken it upon yourself to make sure your friend is alright…<p>
