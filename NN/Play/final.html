        <div id="first">
          <p>You alerted the authorities to the passing of the
             entire Gardner family. That night, much against your own will,
             you were required to accompany the group of officers that went to investigate the
             farmhouse. You were greeted with a terrifying sight. The trees, the house, the well—the
             whole farm was
            glowing with the strange, unearthly color that you’d once seen in the meteorite.</p>

          </div>

        <div id="second">
          <p>As you watched, a bolt of light rose from the well, like tongues of demonic fire,
            and shot towards the stars. You fled, along with the officers,
             but just before you were out of sight, you turned back.</p>
          </div>

          <div id="third">
            <p>The light had faded, but as you watched you saw something feebly rise,
              only to sink back down to the earth. It was just a
              color, but not any color of our world. Seeing it, you knew that some
              trace of whatever had killed the Gardner family still remained there.</p>
